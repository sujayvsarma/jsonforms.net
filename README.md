# JsonForms for .NET
Json Forms, in .NET. Written in .NET Core 3.1, for ASP.NET Core 3.1 (MVC). 
---
Project is inspired by https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms

We will try to maintain as much compatibility with jsonforms.io (by EclipseSource) as possible so that people can use and switch between the two as seamlessly as possible.

NOTE: The effort is not to provide a replacement for JsonForms.io, but simply to provide another option for people (like me!) that do not use JS-frameworks in their work.
